## Stories (3 Seed Examples)

### 1. 3am in Kandy

```json
{
  "id": "story-001",
  "title": "3am in Kandy",
  "slug": "3am-in-kandy",
  "excerpt": "The temple bells wouldn't stop and neither would my thoughts.",
  "coverImageUrl": "/seed/stories/kandy-cover.webp",
  "galleryUrls": [
    "/seed/stories/kandy-1.webp",
    "/seed/stories/kandy-2.webp",
    "/seed/stories/kandy-3.webp"
  ],
  "tags": ["travel", "sri-lanka", "temples", "insomnia"],
  "publishedAt": "2024-01-10T00:00:00Z",
  "isDraft": false,
  "bodyMarkdown": "# 3am in Kandy\n\nThe temple bells started at 3am. Not the gentle, melodic kind you imagine when someone says 'temple bells.' These were aggressive. Insistent. Like the universe had an alarm clock and it was pointed directly at my window.\n\nI was staying in a tiny guesthouse overlooking the lake. The kind of place where the walls are thin enough to hear your neighbor's dreams. The owner, a woman named Chamari, had warned me about the bells.\n\n\"You'll get used to it,\" she said.\n\nI didn't.\n\n## The Walk\n\nBy 3:30, I'd given up on sleep. Pulled on the same hoodie I'd worn for three days straight and walked down to the lake. \n\nKandy at night is different. During the day it's chaos — tuk-tuks, tourists, temple ceremonies. At night it breathes. The water reflects fairy lights from the restaurants that haven't closed yet. Stray dogs wander the paths like they own the place (they do).\n\nI sat on a bench and watched a cat stalk something invisible.\n\n## The Thought\n\nI was 16 and completely alone in a city I didn't know. My family was asleep in Colombo, assuming I was asleep in Kandy. The responsible choice would have been to go back to the guesthouse.\n\nI walked to a 24-hour bakery instead and bought three donuts.\n\nNo regrets."

### 2. The Great Plushie Heist

```json
{
  "id": "story-002",
  "title": "The Great Plushie Heist",
  "slug": "the-great-plushie-heist",
  "excerpt": "How I accidentally smuggled a plushie across international borders.",

  "galleryUrls": [
    "/seed/stories/heist-1.webp"
  ],
  "tags": ["travel", "plushies", "chaos", "airport"],
  "publishedAt": "2024-01-05T00:00:00Z",
  "isDraft": false,
  "bodyMarkdown": "# The Great Plushie Heist\n\nLet me be clear: I did not intentionally commit any crimes. The plushie situation was entirely accidental and also not my fault.\n\n## The Setup\n\nDubai International Airport, 4am. I'd been awake for approximately 47 hours and my brain had stopped processing reality somewhere over the Arabian Sea.\n\nI saw her in the gift shop. A tiny blue whale with the most pathetic little face. I picked her up to look at the price tag.\n\n## The Crime\n\nI don't remember paying. I also don't remember not paying. What I remember is sitting at my gate, holding Bubble (she didn't have a name yet), and wondering if I'd committed theft.\n\nThe receipt in my pocket said yes, I had paid. But the anxiety said maybe double-check.\n\n## The Aftermath\n\nI walked back to the shop. The cashier looked at me like I was unhinged (fair). I showed them the receipt. They confirmed I had, in fact, legally purchased the whale.\n\nI apologized anyway.\n\nBubble has been through a lot."

### 3. First Day in England

```json
{
  "id": "story-003",
  "title": "First Day in England",

  "galleryUrls": [
    "/seed/stories/england-1.webp",
    "/seed/stories/england-2.webp"
  ],
  "tags": ["travel", "england", "moving", "new-chapter"],
  "publishedAt": "2023-09-15T00:00:00Z",
  "isDraft": false,
  "bodyMarkdown": "# First Day in England\n\nThe pilot said the temperature in London was 12°C. I had no frame of reference for what that meant. In Colombo, 12°C doesn't exist.\n\n## The Arrival\n\nHeathrow was overwhelming. Too big, too beige, too many signs pointing in too many directions. I followed the crowds to immigration and tried to look like I knew what I was doing.\n\n\"Purpose of visit?\"\n\n\"Moving here. For school.\"\n\nThe officer stamped my passport without looking up. That was it. I was officially in England.\n\n## The Bus\n\nI took a bus to my new city. It rained the entire way. Not dramatic rain — England doesn't do dramatic. It was a persistent drizzle that made everything look like a watercolor painting left out in the weather.\n\nI pressed my face against the window and watched the gray houses blur past.\n\n## The First Night\n\nMy room was small. The bed was new but felt unfamiliar. Outside, someone was having a loud phone conversation about football.\n\nI unpacked Mochi first. Set her on the pillow. She looked as confused as I felt.\n\n\"We're not in Colombo anymore,\" I told her.\n\nShe didn't respond. She's a plushie.\n\nI stayed awake until 4am (jet lag) and watched British reality TV I didn't understand."
