# Moderation Standard Operating Procedure

> Guidelines for reviewing and moderating user-submitted confessions.

---

## Overview

This document outlines the moderation workflow for Aki's World. The primary goal is to maintain a safe, authentic space while allowing genuine expression.

---

## Moderation Principles

1. **Safety first:** Content suggesting self-harm or harm to others is never published without review.
2. **Authenticity over perfection:** Allow quirky, weird, or mildly edgy content. This isn't a corporate space.
3. **Benefit of the doubt:** When unsure, move to review rather than auto-reject.
4. **Privacy protection:** Never expose anonymous submitter information.
5. **Consistency:** Apply the same standards across all submissions.

---

## Content Categories

### Auto-Approved (Future Feature)
Currently all content goes to pending queue. Auto-approval may be enabled later for low-risk content.

### Pending Review
Standard queue for all new submissions.

### Flagged - Profanity
Contains words from the profanity keyword list. May still be approved if context is appropriate (self-deprecating humor, emphasis without targeting).

### Flagged - Self-Harm (Critical)
Contains keywords related to self-harm or suicidal ideation. These receive special handling:
- User was shown helpline overlay on submission
- Content is locked from public view
- Requires explicit admin review
- Consider the overall tone and context

---

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Access Moderation Queue

1. Log in to admin dashboard
2. Navigate to "Confessions" section
3. Review pending count badge
4. Queue shows oldest submissions first

### Step 2: Evaluate Submission

For each confession, review:

| Aspect | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Content | Is it appropriate for the site's audience? |
| Tone | Does it align with the raw-but-kind voice? |
| Safety | Does it indicate harm to self or others? |
| Spam | Is it promotional or off-topic? |
| Image | If attached, is it appropriate? |

### Step 3: Take Action

**Approve ✓**
- Content is safe and on-brand
- Publish immediately
- Becomes visible in public feed

**Reject ✗**
- Content violates guidelines
- Add moderator note explaining why (internal only)
- Submission is archived, not deleted

**Hold for Review**
- Unsure about the content
- Add note with concerns
- Leave as pending for second opinion

## Handling Self-Harm Flagged Content

### Context Matters

Not all flagged content indicates crisis. Evaluate:

| Signal | Example | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Hyperbole | "I could die of embarrassment" | Usually approve |
| Venting | "Today was exhausting" | Usually approve |
| Seeking help | "I don't know who to talk to" | Consider individual case |
| Crisis language | Direct references to self-harm | Do not approve; consider outreach if possible |

### Decision Framework

1. **Is this expressing a common feeling?** → Likely safe to approve
2. **Is this venting about a specific bad day?** → Likely safe to approve
3. **Does this suggest immediate risk?** → Do not approve; content stays private
4. **Is the person seeking connection?** → Consider approving if not concerning

### Important Notes

- The user has already seen helpline information
- Approving content does NOT mean ignoring the flag
- Add a moderator note tracking your reasoning
- If truly concerned, the submission stays private

---

## Moderator Notes

Add notes to document your decision process. Examples:

**Approved:**
```
Reviewed 2024-01-16. Flagged for keyword "disappearing" but context is about social anxiety venting. Approved - common experience, no crisis indicators.
```

**Rejected:**
```
Reviewed 2024-01-16. Promotional content for external service. Rejected as spam.
```

**Held:**
```
2024-01-16. Unsure about tone. Holding for Aki's review.
```

---

## Report Handling

Users can report published confessions. When reports come in:

1. Review the confession in context
2. Check report reason (inappropriate, spam, harmful)
3. Check report count (multiple reports = higher priority)
4. Decide: keep, reject, or hold

If rejecting a previously approved confession:
- Add note explaining why it was reconsidered
- Confession is removed from public feed

---

## Keyword Lists

### Profanity List (Soft Flag)
Standard profanity terms. Flag but allow if context is appropriate (self-expression, not harassment).

### Self-Harm Keywords (Hard Flag)
Terms related to:
- Suicidal ideation
- Self-injury
- Crisis language
- Disappearing/ending it phrases

**Maintenance:** Review and update keyword lists quarterly. Add new patterns as observed; remove terms that cause too many false positives.

---

## Escalation

For content that's truly concerning:

1. Do not approve the submission
2. Add detailed moderator note
3. The content remains private but preserved
4. The user was already shown helpline resources

Remember: You are not a crisis counselor. The system shows helpline information; your role is content curation.
